                    <h3 id="question-1">What did you enjoy most about building this Course Management Platform?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p id="answer-1">I thoroughly enjoyed implementing the comprehensive authentication system and role-based access control. Creating a secure, scalable backend with JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and proper middleware for authorization was both challenging and rewarding. The integration of Redis for notification queuing and the implementation of background workers for automated reminders showcased real-world application development skills.</p>

                    <h3 id="question-2">What was the most challenging aspect of the project?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p id="answer-2">The most challenging aspect was designing and implementing the complex database relationships using Sequelize ORM. Managing the intricate connections between Users, Facilitators, Course Offerings, and Activity Trackers while maintaining data integrity and implementing proper foreign key constraints required careful planning. Additionally, setting up the Redis-backed notification system with Bull queues for background job processing pushed me to understand asynchronous operations and message queuing systems deeply.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p id="answer-3">For future improvements, I would implement real-time notifications using WebSocket connections to provide instant updates to managers and facilitators. Adding comprehensive audit logging would enhance security and traceability. I'd also suggest implementing file upload capabilities for course materials, creating a dashboard with analytics and reporting features, and adding email notification integration. Performance optimization through database indexing and caching strategies would further enhance the system's scalability.</p>
